The name's Potato. Couch Potato.
===========

Couch Potato compiles your CouchDB mapreduces from local files to flattened, in-db mapreduces so you don't have to do it yourself.

Future features
======
- Syncing down (change in db -> change in files)
- Auth junk
- Commandification (Soon, otherwise what's the point?)
- Other functions
